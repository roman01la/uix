# State

UIx is using [React's state hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components) for local state.

```clojure
(defui form []
  (let [[value set-value!] (uix.core/use-state "")]
    ($ :input {:value value
               :on-change #(set-value! value (.. % -target -value))})))
```

In some React wrappers state is represented as Atom datatype that has has `reset!` and `swap!` operations. We take a similar naming approach and suffix state updating function with a bang `!` denoting that the operating is mutating a value.

> Similar to `swap!`, `set-value!` from the above example also takes a function that will receive current value of return the next value of component's state. Although unlike with `swap!` state updating function doesn't take additional arguments that will be passed into a callback.

When initial value has to be computed before it’s used, it is recommended to pass it in a callback to `use-state`. The callback will be executed only once, in component’s initialization stage.

```clojure
(defn calculate-initial-value []
  ;; expensive computation here)

(uix.core/use-state calculate-initial-value)
```

## Reusable state

Because state is not directly coupled with components it is possible to build reusable behaviors on top of it. In the example below we create `use-validation` function that encapsulates logic that keeps track of a value and applies updates when the value satisfies provided validation function.

```clojure
(defn use-validation [initial-value valid?]
  (let [[value set-value!] (uix.core/use-state initial-value)
        on-change #(let [v (.. % -target -value)]
                    (when (valid? v)
                      (set-value! v)))]
    [value on-change]))

(defui form []
  (let [[value on-change] (use-validation "" #(not (empty? %)))]
    ($ :input {:value value
               :on-change on-change})))
```
